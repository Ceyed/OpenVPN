# OpenVPN
A GUI for openvpn in manjaro linux  <br /><br />

## Planing:
### Version 1:
- [x] Just connect to selected server

### Version 1.1:
- [x] Sort servers from fastest to slowest

### Version 1.2:
- [ ] Add more logs to output

### Version 1.3:
- [ ] Add a image for connection status, 'Red' for 'Not Connected' and 'Green' for 'Connected'

<br />

## TODO:
- [x] Adding more comments in code
- [x] Thread for sorting servers
- [x] If connection has been established user clicked on 'Connect' again, last connection should be killed then start another one
